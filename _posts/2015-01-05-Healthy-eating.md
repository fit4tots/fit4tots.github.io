Why is it such a challenge to get kids to eat a healthy balanced diet? I don't think we know the answer here at Fit4Tots, but here are some tips: 

1. Make mealtimes fun - whether it's in how the food is presented, or how you interact with your kids while they are eating it, it often goes down better with a smile. I have been known to make food faces or bury carrot coins under rice or couscous sand, just to make the veg more fun. Curly kale became a hit for a while as I convinced my 4 year old it made her hair go curly while she was eating it (but not long enough for her to look in a mirror!). 

2. Get your children cooking with you. It helps if you can ignore the mess. I get mine to do the safer parts of cooking (stirring cold ingredients for banana pancakes, dipping fish or turkey into egg and breadcrumbs for homemade fingers, sprinkling their own veg and cheese onto pitta pizzas)

3. Keep the sweet treats for special occasions. My 4 year old knows that if she has an ice cream on holiday or when we are on a day trip that there won't be any more sweet treats that day or the next (not that she would be likely to turn it down if offered!)

4. What are you eating? Children learn so much from their parents, if you eat your greens with gusto, then they are likely to follow suit. 

5. If they are old enough, help them understand why it is good to eat up their vegetables, protein and carbs. If they want to grow tall, run fast, jump higher, it will all help their bones and muscles grow!
