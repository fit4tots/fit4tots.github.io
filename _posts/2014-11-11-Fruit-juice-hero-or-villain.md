How many of us give our children fruit juice thinking it’s a healthy drink? That’s what we’ve been taught. It is one of our ‘5 a day’ and a good source of our daily vitamin C requirement. It is hydrating and refreshing on a hot day and a healthier alternative to sweetened soda drinks. Not so it seems, at least in terms of the added sugar in their diet.

Several articles in the media today (11 November 2014) are covering Action on Sugar’s claim that we should ‘ban’ it from our diets, especially our children’s diets as many fruit juice drinks targeted at children contain more sugar than regular coca cola or other soft drinks. They undertook a survey that showed that “a quarter (25%) of children’s juices can contain at least six teaspoons of sugars (25g) per 200ml - the maximum ADULT daily intake of free sugars” [click here for details](http://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/actiononsugar/Press%20Release%20/141931.html#sthash.9rNnSYdm.dpuf).

Confusing eh? However,  advice from Public Health England remains the same, that a glass of unsweetened fruit juice contributes to your 5 a day. This is unlikely to change in a hurry, but it is worth thinking about how much juice your children have in their diets and whether any juice drinks contain added sugar. As ever with packaged items, it’s best read the label on any cartons to see if there's any added sugars, limit the volume your children drink and remember that the best way to get your vitamin C from fruit is by eating the fruit itself - refreshing, hydrating and fills up those hungry tummies. And of course, if faced with a choice between cola and fruit juice, at least the fruit juice has some goodness in it despite the sugar.


In the Fit4Tots household fruit juice is a treat and our children know that it always comes mixed with water (and a straw for the added treat/blowing bubbles value).
