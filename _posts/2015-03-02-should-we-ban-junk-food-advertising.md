Almost two thirds of us want a ban on advertising junk food before 9pm, as part of protecting children from the influence of advertisers, according to a poll carried out by ComRes this month. 

You can read the full results [here](http://comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Final-Results_RCPCH_Child-Health_Feb-2015.pdf).

I would firmly agree with this, in fact, I wonder why the other third donâ€™t agree on the ban on advertising?  Perhaps they work in the junk food industry? 

My children are still fairly young and their TV viewing time and what they view is easy to control (a limited amount of CBeebies so no advertising at all), but as they get older this may change, and I may not always be with them when they are watching. Advertising toys is one thing, that puts pressure on parents pockets, but advertising foods that are high in sugar, fat and salt makes these food seem acceptable or even normal (especially when accompanied by spurious health claims or images of fit, healthy and happy families). 

The UK has the highest rate of childhood obesity in Europe, and we need to be taking action in all areas, prevention is often cheaper than treating the problem, but harder to identify. The poll was undertaken in a run up to an election and was commissioned by doctors. We know that the NHS is under pressure treating the young and the elderly. Politicians and educated parents can help by making policies that prevent over exposure to the foods and lifestyles that cause the problem in the first place.

It is our responsibility as parents to encourage healthy habits in our children, but it will help us in that task if we do not have to also battle against the expensive marketing campaigns of multinational corporations in doing so!
