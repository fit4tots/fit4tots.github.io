**Clevedon sea front** - a great place to scoot or cycle, collect pebbles and build pebble towers, catch crabs and throw stones into rock pools and explore the Salthouse Fields playground. Take a healthy, balanced picnic and get the kids to choose their treat - whether it’s an ice-cream, a bounce on the bouncy castle or a ride on the train.

**Ashton Court** - a great place to bring a picnic and explore the woods, say hello to the deer, climb a steep hill, scoot or ride down the paths. There’s a small play area and a cafe (and often an ice-cream van near the main house).

**Bristol harbourside** - we love exploring the harbour - watching the boats, maybe catching a ferry, crossing bridges, and splashing in the fountains around Millennium Square or opposite the Hippodrome. If it’s raining then the M-Shed is great to explore and usually has some activities for the little ones in school holidays. 

I’m sure you have plenty more ideas - please share them with the rest of the Fit4Tots community on our [Facebook page](www.facebook.com/Fit4TotsUK)
