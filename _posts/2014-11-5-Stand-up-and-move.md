As a society, we are moving less. We spend a lot of time in our cars, on public transport, sitting behind a desk in and office, classroom or at home or sitting in front of the TV. 

NHS guidelines suggest that under-5s should be physically active at least 3 hours spread throughout the day. This could be light activity that involves moving around and playing, as well as more energetic activity like skipping, hopping, running and jumping. I don't know about you, but many under 5s I know can't sit still for long anyway! However, data on physical activity from the Health Survey for England shows that only around a third of children meet these guidelines by the time they are 5. What's happening?  And why is it so hard to meet these guidelines for the other two thirds. Busy lives, and kids natural attraction to TV, and in the case of some toddlers close to my heart, an aversion to walking if they know how far it will be! 

So what can you do? Get outside is always my answer in fair weather, just walking up and down the street can be an adventure, whether on a scooter, a bike or on foot. We have races, treasure hunts (find things in different colours, or shapes) and if we are lucky we find a friend to chat to too (although that is perhaps for my benefit!). It's hard to find the inspiration on a rainy day though - we have pretend exercise classes (dictated by a 4 year old this can get interesting), and find ways to make simple obstacle courses to keep us moving. It's not always easy though, especially on one of 'those' days, the grey, tired and grumpy days when sleep deprivation, kiddie tantrums or the intrusion of work stress gets everyone down. If you have the energy, it's always worth battling with boots and wellies as fresh air and getting the blood circulation going can really lift the mood! 

Getting moving is great for you and the kids. It helps build bone and muscle, boosts mood and the immune system and is a great bonding experience. It doesn't need special kit, but just a bit of imagination. We will share our ideas here and in our classes but there are some great ones on the website below too, just to get you thinking.
