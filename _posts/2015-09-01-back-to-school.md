September is a great time of year. It seems to be the sunniest month although there’s a crispness in the air in the mornings that reminds you summer is behind us. 

I like to take advantage of the sun and warmth as much as I can by taking our play and activities outside with the kids. Whether it’s a tea time picnic in the garden or exploring the lanes nearby for blackberries and other treasures. Today it was all about collecting acorns with my 3 year old - an opportunity to practice counting, compare sizes and race each other up and down the road overtime we found another one! 

September is also a time for new starts, whether it’s a new class with your toddler, a new school experience for your older children or a new fitness activity for parents. I wonder what you will be trying this year? 

I always have a sugar free September - after the indulgence of ice cream and holidays over the summer. It means I try and find some sugar free alternatives for the kids too - replacing sugar with mashed banana in muffins and flapjacks and using almond flour and coconut to sweeten apple and blackberry crumble toppings. No-one seems to notice too much! Give it a go if you can. 

I love getting back to my Fit4Tots classes in the new school term. So much energy and enthusiasm and some of the returning Tots have got faster and fitter so I can think of some new challenges in our games and songs!
