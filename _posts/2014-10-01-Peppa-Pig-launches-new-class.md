At the beginning of October we began our Fit4Tots pre-schoolers class in Long Ashton. It was great fun to see 16 children and their parents, grandparents and carers joining in a wide variety of activities in the Long Ashton Village Hall. We even got coverage of our activities in the North Somerset Times.

What was even more fun was that Peppa Pig joined us for an animal inspired warm up and she and the kids had a great time running around the hall as tigers, crocodiles, eagles and girafffes. 

Once we were all warm, Peppa had to go and have a rest while the kids and parents undertook a series of activities around the hall. We saw some excellent ball skills, super-fast running, and fast feet on the ladder activity. Our first class gave a flavour of some of the activities we will run throughout the term. There will be ‘Olympics’ weeks with running, jumping and throwing skills, ‘ball skills weeks’ with kicking, bouncing, catching and running skills.
