      My 4 year old daughter and 2 year old twins really enjoyed the fits4tots session.
      <span class="show-for-medium-up">
        My twins are usually quite shy but were drawn into the fun warm up session and thoroughly enjoyed the easy to follow, fun activities.
      </span>
      Great for burning off some energy and getting them involved in group play. Would highly recommend!
