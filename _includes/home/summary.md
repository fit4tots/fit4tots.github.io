### What we do

Fit4Tots classes are designed to be energetic and fun and build valuable skills in balance, coordination and agility. We want to build healthy habits for life and use music and games to make the experience a really positive one for all children.

Fit4Tots classes offer a broad range of sports and fitness activities for children from 2 to 7 years old. Children get to try out and build skills for a variety of sports in a fun and varied environment. We offer classes in schools, nurseries and community venues and  build a foundation of healthy fitness habits through sport, games, music and movement.
