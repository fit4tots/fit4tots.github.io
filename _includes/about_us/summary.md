Fit4Tots was established by Sarah Dineen and Lesley Waldron; qualified personal trainers, nutritionists and, most importantly, mums to young children. Our goal is to reinforce healthy lifestyle habits from a young age through fitness, sport and play, helping to encourage positive associations with exercise, healthy eating and rest. We deliver classes in schools, nurseries and community venues and aim to make this program available for as many young children as possible to participate and enjoy.

Our classes aim to offer a broad range of sports and fitness to pre-school and reception age children, so that they get to try out and build skills for a variety of sports in a fun and varied environment. We have always been keen to make fitness and sport fun for our own little ones (as well as ourselves) and want to share this with as many others as possible.
