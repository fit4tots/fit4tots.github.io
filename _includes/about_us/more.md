We offer classes for pre-schoolers, and school-age children (mainly up to Key Stage 1). At present classes are available in North Somerset and Bristol.

Classes will encourage children to try a variety of activities each week,  either linked to one particular sport, such as football or basketball, or to a group of sports, such as athletics. Our activities are designed to develop the skills and coordination children will need when they play sports as they get older. Turn taking, working as a team and playing for a purpose will be a part of our activities but we will not necessarily play a full team game.

We can also offer family fitness classes, where children and their parents can take part in an activity together.

If we don't yet offer a class near you, please get in touch as we may well be bringing one to  your area soon.
