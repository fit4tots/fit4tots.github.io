### Class content

Classes are planned to encourage the development of key skills for all sports; including hand eye coordination, agility and balance, running, jumping, throwing, catching and kicking. Classes encourage cooperation and turn taking, independence and team work in various sessions. They are designed to be a fun and active 30-45 minutes getting children's heart rate up and developing skills and enthusiasm for sports and fitness that we hope will stay with them throughout their lives.

We use music and active games in our warm up and circle time and bring a variety of equipment to support our activities and sporting skills.  Classes end with stretching and relaxation and we hope that the children will take away with them some activities they can practice in the pre-school or nursery setting or with their parents.

We don't need a huge amount of space and can tailor our classes to the space available, although the space will limit the number of children we can take in each class and the type of activities we can use. Nursery staff are encouraged to join in with the classes.
