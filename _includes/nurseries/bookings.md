### Regular bookings

We can come in to offer a regular weekly class to groups of pre-school children in your nursery during term time. Our weekly 30-40 minute sessions are carefully designed to build gross and fine motor skills as well as coordination, balance, fitness and enthusiasm for sport. We like to introduce simple team-work based activities as well as partner and whole group activities. We love watching skills develop over the course of a term and hearing about the children taking the activities back to their peers and siblings.

Our pre-school classes are design to promote skills and idea that will give children confidence and enjoyment in the PE and sports at school.
