### Fitness for kids

We also run after school fitness classes will introduce children to a variety of fun exercises involving cardiovascular and an element of body weight strength training. Some classes are delivered in a circuit; encouraging some independence and cooperation between children, and other classes involve the whole  class with music and movement. We can offer these classes to a variety of age groups, but our emphasis is on Key Stage 1.
