### Workshops

Fit4Tots can come in and run specialist workshops to fit with any sports or health themed weeks your school might be running. We specialise in Key Stage 1 - introducing children to coordination and motor skills required for many sports through fun warm up sessions, activities and games. We can focus on fitness, athletics and a number of other sports, we can also run introductory Pilates sessions.

We can come in to your school for a full day or half day depending on the number of children and space available. We particularly love introducing Reception children to our team games and Pilates!

For older children we can offer more fitness based workshops.

Every child wins in a Fit4Tots session - our mission is for children to leave our sessions feeling confident, enthusiastic, excited about sports and fitness and having pushed their hearts and bodies to achieve more!
