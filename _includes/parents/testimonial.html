    My 4 year old daughter and 2 year old twins really enjoyed the fits4tots session.

        My twins are usually quite shy but were drawn into the fun warm up session and thoroughly enjoyed the easy to follow, fun activities.

    Great for burning off some energy and getting them involved in group play. Would highly recommend!
